<p>Software engineering is a field of study that focuses on the development of software systems. It involves applying engineering principles to design, build, test, and maintain software products. Software engineers use various programming languages, tools, and methodologies to create software solutions that meet specific requirements.</p>
<p>Some common software engineering practices include agile development, continuous integration and deployment, version control, code reviews, and automated testing. These practices aim to improve the efficiency of the software development process and ensure that high-quality software is delivered on time and within budget.</p>
